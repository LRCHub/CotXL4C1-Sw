God is good- God is good- God is good (repeat 3 times)
God is good and he will always provide
There's no place for the infidel to hide

God is good- God is good- God is good

This was my land, now it's yours
But when we're gone, it will always be gone

God is good- God is good- God is good

Slit the throat of the infidel
Kill the children so they never will tell

God is good- God is good- God is good (repeat 3 times)
